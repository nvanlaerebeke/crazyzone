# WeKan

The wekan application is installed with this repository.  
When a clean WeKan instance is set up, there is no user yet.  

To create a user, go to the [sign-up](https://wekan.crazyzone.be/sign-up)

Register a user and log it with it.
If an internal server error happens, this is due to no SMTP being configured, you can ignore the error.
